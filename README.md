# GitHubSearch

A more awesome way to search GitHub repositories than github.com's official search.

See it in production at [https://infinite-atoll-45060.herokuapp.com/](https://infinite-atoll-45060.herokuapp.com/)

### Development

* React/Redux on the frontend
  * [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com) w/ inline styles
  * CSS Modules
* Simple Express app on the backend
* Webpack for build process

All frontend code is in the `app` folder, all backend code in `server`.

Based on [choonkending's awesome boilerplate](https://github.com/choonkending/react-webpack-node).

### Run it yourself

`npm install` and then

```
npm run dev
```
to start the development server

```
npm run build
```
to build for production

```
npm start
```
 to run in production
